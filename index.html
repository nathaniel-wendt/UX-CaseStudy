											<h2>Case Study :&nbsp; Unity Notes</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My role: &nbsp; <b>Visual Design, UX/UI, Branding, Prototyping</b></p>
										<p><b>Inspiration is everywhere but being able to capture and share your ideas with a team is cumbersome with
											existing software. &nbsp;All the note taking web apps I have used in the past were either too basic
											(which didn't allow me to collaborate effectively) or too complicated (which made them frustrating to use).
											Unity Notes is a prototype web application I developed which gives teams an easy and intuitive way to collaborate online -
											ensuring great ideas never get lost.</b></p>
										<p>The challenge of this project was to follow a User-Centered Design Process and develop a SaaS Web Application from the ground up.
											I decided to channel the frustrations I had with existing note taking apps (like Evernote and Google Keep) to develop my own app that
											addresses the issues I experience when sharing content online.</p>

						<h2>Research</h2>
						<blockquote>"UX design is about creating solutions that respond to the needs and desires of your target consumers, in a way that is usable, pleasing, and memorable." - Harish Venkatesan</blockquote>
					</header>

						<h2>Online Survey</h2>
						<p>&emsp;User-Centered Design doesn’t happen alone.  Since this project was born of my own frustration (looking at you Google Keep) I had to make sure the problem wasn't just in my head. Were others experiencing the same dissatisfaction I was?
							Creating a <a class="heavy" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10gXx_f1jmbxJo2ph8GdEqb5O0CI9Q7U9MLM7G6L6QgA/edit" target="_blank">survey</a> was a simple way to find out. Facebook and Slack (Bloc Hacker Club, FreeCodeCamp) turned out to be great resources to target users within my desired demographic for free.
							I asked questions to understand how users interacted with their devices.  Qualified them by finding out whether or not they worked in a collaborative environment.  And learned who my primary competitors were.</p>
						<p>&emsp;Most importantly it gave respondents an opportunity to describe what they liked and disliked about the current tool(s) they use.  An interesting correlation emerged- When their tool made it simple to save content they almost always mentioned it being difficult to sort and find the content they saved.
						This insight would prove to be a strong competitive advantage and a main focal point during the development of Unity Notes.</p>

					<h4><mark>Survey Highlights</mark></h4>
					<ul class="statistics">
						<li class="style2">
							<span class="icon fa-mobile-phone"></span>
							<strong>92 %</strong> Preferred using their Smartphone to browse online. Laptops came in second. Desktops third. (69.2% and 53.8% respectively).
						</li>
						<li class="style3">
							<span class="icon fa-paperclip"></span>
							<strong>69 %</strong> Often times saved the content they found online. "ability to organize" was the most liked feature of the software they used.
						</li>
						<li class="style4">
							<span class="icon fa-comments-o"></span>
							<strong>84 %</strong> Worked in a collaborative setting.  The majority of respondents (66%) were designers in the tech industry.
						</li>
						<li class="style5">
							<span class="icon fa-frown-o"></span>
							<strong>67 %</strong> experienced difficulty sorting and finding what they had saved with the software they were currently using.

							<ol>
								<li>The options the respondents had to choose from on one question was: "never" "occasionally" or "often".  Looking back I realized those answers are highly subjective. Adding context e.g. "Occasionally (1-5 times a week)" would have removed the subjectivity and given me more accurate information to work with.</li>
								<li>I didn't ask what features they wish their current product had.  This would have been a great opportunity to discover important features that may have been overlooked. It could also be very valuable in determing what to prioritize for a Minimum Viable Product.</li>
								<li>I also realized afterwards that I had no way of contacting the respondents to clarify their responses or ask follow-up questions.  Adding: "Please enter your email if it is ok to contact you with any further questions" would have allowed me to stay in touch with those willing to offer their opinion.</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>User Personas</h2>
						<p>&emsp;Most of my survey respondents were anonymous but thankfully a few were colleagues which allowed me to follow up and conduct in-person interviews.  Surveys are great way to validate a hypothesis but interviews offer a depth of understanding and empathy that proved invaluable-
							I was actually surprised by how much I was able to learn just by getting in front of my potential users and having a conversation.</p>
						<p>&emsp;The interviews were also useful to inform the creation of User Personas.  By understand their unique workflows I was able to create three exaggerated personas to guide my development process and ensure the end user was always the North Star throughout the decision-making process.</p>

											<p>Aside from relying on my Mentor's feedback Unity Notes was a solo project so my biggest asset was time.  If this had been a
												collaborative effort (or had the project been requested by a client) I would have needed
												to adjust my design process to account for potential budget constraints and stakeholder demands.</p>

									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<img src="images/portrait.png" style="margin:20px 0px">
								</header>
								<p>33 year old Colorado transplant of 4 years (Born and raised in Iowa).  I’m the youngest of five children and definitely a momma’s boy.  My interest in design began in 8th grade when I discovered MS Paint could pass as a makeshift CAD program to make cleaner woodworking plans.  Throughout my 20's I worked as an independent contractor for a small design company in Iowa. Providing customer service to existing clients and eventually transitioning those sweet MS Paint skills into Photoshop to create wireframes and low-fidelity site mockups for new clients.</p>
								<p>I enrolled in Bloc's Full-Time Designer Track program in March of 2017, quitting my job of four years to focus all of my attention on becoming a User Experience Designer.  It has been five months since I've started the program and I've learned enough to be dangerous.  I have a greater appreciation of the design process and the benefits of conducting thorough research.  What I need now is real-world experience.  My goal is to find a local design firm who sees my potential and who's willing to help me become the best UX Designer this world has ever seen.</p>
								<p>In the meantime I will continue to learn all that I can through books, webinars, and meetups. Becoming a skilled UX Designer is definitely an arduous process at times but I truly enjoy learning all that I can about human behavior and how that translates into designing functional and memorable experiences for users.</p>

							<h2>About This Site</h2>
							<p>I started learning Web Development from the ground up in March of 2017 so my knowledge of Javascript is basic.  My intention was to code my
								portfolio from scratch but plans changed when I found out Viget was offering an Apprenticeship in User Experience Design (My Dream Job!!).
								A Colleague at Bloc recommended <a href=”https://pixelarity.com/” target="_blank">Pixelarity</a> and thankfully I have enough experience with HTML and CSS to open
								the hood and make it my own. </p>
